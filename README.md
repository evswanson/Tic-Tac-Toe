TicTacToe

-So far I have made the engine for the game and I am currently
working on the GUI portion of it.
-For the GUI I am creating a board with 9 buttons that the user
can click to make their move. I have the basics of it down, but
I am having some trouble with the making the button unclickable
once it has already been clicked.
-I was able to make the buttons unclickable
-I do not know how to link the GUI to the engine

-I changed the color and size of the X's and O's for the buttons
-I created a start up stage that only has a "Play Game" button. I will eventually add more to the stage
-I created a Game Over stage that displays the winner or announces if there is a draw. I also added a "Play Again" button
-I created a counter that adds 1 each time someone clicks a square. When the counter reaches 9 and there is no winner it displays a draw
-I currently have 3 stages, the start up, the game board, and the game over screen

-I was able to create the super tic tac toe board
-I was able to successfully create the game by using a list to store 9 grids and another list to store the 9 boards that were created.
-I was able to successfully make a winning board unplayable and if the move would have gone to an unplayable board then the other player can chosse
anywhere else to go
